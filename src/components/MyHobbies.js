                    <p>For a vacation or a long weekend, I choose a trip to the mountains. This is my favorite activity, so I try to go as often as possible, regardless of the season. My best-loved destination are Tatra Mountains. </p>
                    <p>During the week and at weekends, when the weather is nice, I like to go roller-skating or cycling. Whenever there is an opportunity, I try to participate in various events related to roller skating, e.g. Night Skating in Pozna≈Ñ. </p>
